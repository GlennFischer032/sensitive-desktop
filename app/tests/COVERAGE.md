## Test Suite Structure

The test suite is divided into:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
  - Config tests
  - Middleware tests
  - Auth functionality tests
  - Security functionality tests
  - Client tests
  - App initialization tests
  - Session utility tests

- **Functional Tests**: Testing integrated functionality
  - Auth endpoints
  - Connections management
  - Error handling
  - Route protection
  - Token management

## Key Areas with Strong Coverage

1. **Authentication Middleware**: The token_required and admin_required decorators have robust tests
2. **Main Application Configuration**: App initialization, session config, CORS setup, etc.
3. **Connection Management Views**: The connections routes have good coverage at 70%
4. **Error Handling**: API error handling has comprehensive tests
5. **App Entry Point**: Now at 80% coverage
6. **Auth Client**: Now at 100% coverage

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Client Coverage**: Most API clients still have low coverage (15-30%)
2. **API Endpoints**: API route coverage is generally lower than view routes
3. **Utility Modules**: Session and Swagger utilities could benefit from more testing

## Future Test Improvements

Here are recommendations for improving test coverage:

1. **Client Mocking**: Create standardized mocks for each client type to simplify testing
2. **API Testing**: Add more API endpoint tests, possibly with integration tests
3. **Session Testing**: Continue improving tests for session management utilities
4. **Error Cases**: Add more tests for error cases and boundary conditions
5. **Configuration Tests**: Add tests for different configuration scenarios

## Running Tests

Run the entire test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

Run with coverage report:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Run only unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Run only functional tests
python -m pytest tests/functional/
```

## Pre-commit Integration

Tests are automatically run with:
```bash
pre-commit run pytest-check
```
