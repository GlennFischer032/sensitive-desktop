## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with the highest-impact, most visible components
2. Make changes incrementally, focusing on one component type at a time
3. Test each change thoroughly before moving to the next
4. Document all patterns in the style guide as they are standardized
5. Regularly review progress against the checklist

## Style Review Checklist

When reviewing each component or page:

- [ ] Are all colors from the variable system?
- [ ] Is spacing consistent with the spacing scale?
- [ ] Are text styles consistent with the type scale?
- [ ] Are borders and shadows consistent?
- [ ] Is the responsive behavior using standard patterns?
- [ ] Have appropriate mixins been applied?
- [ ] Does the component adapt well across breakpoints?
- [ ] Is the component fully accessible?
- [ ] Are ARIA attributes properly used?
- [ ] Does the component work with keyboard navigation?
- [ ] Is the CSS optimized for performance?

## Success Metrics

- Reduced number of unique CSS declarations
- Improved component consistency across pages
- Faster development of new features
- Easier maintenance of existing styles
- Better visual harmony throughout the application
- Improved accessibility scores
- Faster page loading and rendering times
